# DiscreteCosineTransform
A Repository Containing the explanation of Discrete Cosine Transform

## Project Overview
The notebook will guide you through implement the Discrete Cosine Tranform by scratch, and show how the number of selected nodes affects the reconstructed image.

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository on your computer. For those who are not familiar with command line utilities, GitHub has developed this utility which lets do pretty much everything you need through a GUI.
   [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Download the dataset (the link is included in the jupyter notebook).
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook OpenCV_BaseCommandsTutorial.ipynb and follow the instructions.

__NOTE:__ Chances are part of the code may not run due to some missing packages. Please make sure to go through the notebook and retrieve all the necessary packages. If you have installed anaconda, you should be ok with most of them. Don't forget to install opencv. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

## GitHub rendering Problems

Sometimes GitHub cannot render the jupyter notebook properly. In such a situation, go to the [nbviewer website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and copy and paste the URL address of the notebook so as to render it on the browser.
